## Overview
The challenge was to build out the interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. It was indeed a very fun ride as I utilized my newly learned skills in Javascript and couldn't be more pround

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process
I started by observing the figma files to know what area to start from. Built out the HTML first then went on to the Styling when that was done, I moved on to the Javascript and testing interactivity as well as Responsiveness

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [ES6+ Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- BEM Naming Conventions
- Cross Browser Compatibility


### What I learned

The BEM Naming convention really does help to make your code more readable. I also found it beneficial to see the outline of my project before styling it, so I used ``` border: 2px solid white ``` a lot of times in determining the right positioning of things. As for Javascript this was the first time I used the event handler `onclick`.

### Continued development
 
For future terms and continued development I plan to work on my Javascript naming conventions. Currently I used a lot of vague naming conventions which I know is not good practice and I plan to improve on that.
